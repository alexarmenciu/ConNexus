# Wassim Wazzi Contribution Report

## Tasks Completed

### Backend
- Created the user model, and the corresponding routes and controller to enable updating and deleting users.
- Improved the contacts model to include a `user_id` field.
- Performed encryption and decryption of the user's contacts using the `cryptojs` module.
- Documented the entire backend with JSDoc.


#### FrontEnd

Did minor changes and improvements on the frontend. When I refactored the contact routes so they conform to the RESTful API, I also refactored the frontend to use the new routes.
