# Dijian Guo Contribution Report

For this project, my main contribution was as a frontend developer for the web application, though mid way through I ended up working on backend as well since I found it to be more efficient as I debugged and modified server side code. I did so especially since I wanted to test the features but as bugs and adjustments kept coming up on the backend side it was making things difficult. Also, I worked with Leo at the start for the foundation of our app with login/register and session.

Here are some commits among many small ones that tracks my progress (I committed under Potato455 for many of the code commits):

I also worked on the architecture and final report, mainly within the implementation part, and we all worked together on planning and organization throughout the project.


On another note, much like the first assignment, I tried to volunteer into a leadership position as I tried to make sure things were progressing smoothly, communicating with the team about the various goals to be met and scheduling the meetings for different purposes.
