## Overview of the Workflow Strategy Employed

We split all the work at the very beginning so that everyone could contribute equally, assigning Alex to the requirements, Dijian and Wassim to the architecture, and Leo to set up the project as required by the documents the rest of the team wrote. Upon completion of the requirements and architecture, we reconvened to peer review our work during a Thursday weekly meeting.

Following the setup of the project, we decided to assign work based on technological proficiency, assigning Leo and Dijian to the frontend, and Alex and Wassim to the backend. Each pair of two worked together to complete the tasks assigned to them, and reviewed the other person's work. Further, each of the teams would support the other team (for example, our login feature wasn't working, so Wassim and Alex helped fix backend functionality to ensure Dijian and Leo could implement the login properly).

Research was done as a group, and peer reviewed by other members of the team. We believe this to be a rigorous and exhaustive method of completing the assignment, as every piece of work would receive exhaustive checks before being approved for use in the project submission.

Contributions were made by individuals directly to the Gitlab repo. Issues were used to track the completion of the project epic, with weekly “sprints” focused on completing specific functionality on the project. The first sprint was dedicated to planning the requirements and architecture, the second to building the webapp, the third to completing the presentation, and the fourth to completing the final report and related artifacts.

Meetings were employed twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays to track completion of the project and complete code and paper reviews as detailed above. Attendance rate of the meetings was almost perfect and we considered them to be strong motivators, as they encouraged members of the group to not fall behind on their work.

To ensure privacy and security, we used:

- GitLab issues to track completion and progress towards the project completion
- Gitlab for version control and artifact storage
- Discord for communication (has encryption features)
